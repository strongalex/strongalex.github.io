<p>This robot was designed for the 2025 FRC game, "Reefscape." Its primary goals were to score PVC pipes on elevated posts, launch large kickballs into a net approximately 8 feet high, and climb onto a rectangular "cage." The robot performed at a very high level, advancing far into its division at the world championships. My main contributions were to the scoring and claw subsystem. The robot was originally designed in Onshape.
