<p>A robot made for the 2025 FRC game, Reefscape. It's objective was to score pvc pipes onto posts and score large kickballs into a net ~8 ft in the air, and then climb onto a rectangular 'cage'. It competed at a very high level and made it far into its division at worlds. I worked mostly on the scoreing/claw subystem. Originally cadded in Onshape
